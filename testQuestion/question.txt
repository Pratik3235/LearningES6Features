You are given the following array of user objects:

javascript
Copy
Edit
const users = [
  { id: 1, name: "Alice", age: 28 },
  { id: 2, name: "Bob", age: 34 },
  { id: 3, name: "Charlie", age: 22 }
];
Write an ES6 function formatUserInfo that:

Takes a user object as a parameter (use object destructuring),

Uses default parameters to set age to 18 if it's not provided,

Returns a template literal string like:
"User Alice (ID: 1) is 28 years old."

Then use arrow functions and spread operator to:

Create a new array of users that includes all original users,

Plus one new user { id: 4, name: "Diana" } (note: no age),

Map over the array to generate the formatted strings using your formatUserInfo function.

📝 Expected Output:
javascript
Copy
Edit
[
  "User Alice (ID: 1) is 28 years old.",
  "User Bob (ID: 2) is 34 years old.",
  "User Charlie (ID: 3) is 22 years old.",
  "User Diana (ID: 4) is 18 years old."
